//! store: every file the application keeps, through one seam.
//!
//! The application's data lives under its roots (data/, auth/) as named files
//! in folders. This module is the only way to reach them, so the rules of the
//! disk the data may end up on are kept in one place:
//!
//! **THE RULES ARE FAT'S, ON EVERY HOST.** On gopher-metal the data is a FAT
//! volume. On Linux it is not, and a Linux that allowed what FAT refuses would
//! hide the difference until the data moved. So the Store keeps FAT's rules
//! here too:
//!
//!   - **A name FAT can hold**, or the call is refused with `error.BadName`:
//!     1 to 96 bytes (fat16.zig's max_name), printable ASCII, none of
//!     `" * / : < > ? \ |`, not `.` or `..`, not ending in a dot or a space.
//!   - **Case does not tell two names apart; it is kept for display.** A name
//!     that differs from an existing one only in case IS that one (Steve,
//!     2026-10-02, option 1): reading `Plan.md` finds `plan.md`, and writing
//!     `Plan.md` writes `plan.md`, where FAT would. A new name keeps the case
//!     it was given.
//!
//! The rules apply to the names a call would CREATE and to the names it looks
//! up. The roots themselves (configured paths, such as prod's
//! /home/steve/AngryGopher/prod) are the host's and are not checked: a path
//! that exists is taken as it is, and only a name that is not found is looked
//! for in another case.
//!
//! **A FOLDER HOLDS AT MOST 65,536 ENTRIES ON FAT** (the spec's 2 MiB; a long
//! name takes 2 to 4 of them). gopher-metal refuses to grow a folder past it:
//! the write that needed the room fails as a full disk would
//! (`error.NoSpaceLeft`). Linux has no such limit, and this Store does not
//! count entries on every write, so at that bound the two hosts would
//! differ. What the application's folders can reach (gopher-metal QUEUE item
//! 68; prod's counts from 2026-10-02):
//!
//!   - `data/players`: one folder per player, two entries each, so about
//!     32,000 players. **Nothing bounds it** but game_limits' 5 new players
//!     an address an hour. Prod: 19.
//!   - `data/lynrummy`: one folder per player who has played. Prod: 5.
//!   - a player's `sessions` folders: at most 500 (game_limits). Prod's
//!     largest: 65.
//!   - a conversation's `sessions`: a topic is about five files of 2-4
//!     entries each, so a few thousand topics. A topic's uploads: about
//!     16,000. Prod's largest folder of all: 70 entries.
//!
//! So prod is a few hundred times inside every one of them. The players
//! folder is the one that grows without a bound of its own; when it nears
//! the limit, the fix is a fan-out (`data/players/<first digit>/p...`),
//! not a bigger folder.
//!
//! **AN ERROR IS NOT AN EMPTY FILE.** `readOrEmpty` says the difference between
//! a file that is not there ("nothing yet") and one that will not read.
