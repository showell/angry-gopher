{-| Popup ceremony. The popup is the modal that appears at
turn-end with one of the admins (Angry Cat / Oliver / Steve)
narrating the outcome. Single OK button, no focus trap or
ESC handler.

`viewPopup` is msg-polymorphic — caller passes the dismiss
Msg, so this module doesn't need to know about `Main.Msg`.
