module Game.BoardView exposing
    ( boardWithWings
    , viewBoard
    )

{-| The board widget — stacks, drag wings, and the
board-frame overlay for an in-flight intra-board drag.

`boardShellWith` (private) is the bare board shell (khaki
rectangle, `position: relative`, fixed 800×600). Used both
by the drag-aware `boardWithWings` and by the puzzle's
static `viewBoard`.

`boardWithWings` is the in-flow drag-aware board (shell with
stack children and, during a drag, wing targets and a
board-frame floater). The viewport-frame floater for
hand-origin drags lives in `Game.Drag.draggedOverlay`.

A drag is rendered immediately on mousedown; the source stack
hides and the floater takes over at the same screen position.
Click-vs-drag arbitration is a mouseup-time outcome judgment,
not a state the View needs to know about.

-- STATIC RENDERING
--
-- The minimum surface to draw a board: a list of positioned
-- stacks on the standard board shell. No model, no drag
-- state, no gameId. Used by surfaces where there's nothing
-- to interact with (the puzzle V1, snapshot views).
--
-- Polymorphic in `msg` so callers with their own Msg type
-- can use it without going through `Main.Msg`.

-- DRAG OVERLAYS


{-| Board-frame drag overlay nodes: a DOM child of the board
shell (which is `position: relative`) with `position: absolute`
and board-frame top/left. Renders intra-board drags. Empty list
when no overlay applies — keeps the caller's concatenation
straightforward.

The viewport-frame counterpart for hand drags is
`Game.Drag.draggedOverlay`.
